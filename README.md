# Label-Noise-Reduction-through-Self-Supervision.
Learning from noisy labeled data is a challenging problem in machine learning, where the training data is labeled with errors or inconsistencies. This can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models and limit their ability to accurately generalize to new data.
# Learning from sample with certain label.
Once we find the labels for the clusters by voting from the given noisy label of dataset( images), we find datapoints( images) with certain label. Then we train the model that has been trained in self-supervised manner.
